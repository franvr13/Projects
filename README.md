**Projects**

Hello!
This is my personal repository where I show the projects I have done in learning programming languages from 0.

**What does it contain?**

This repository contains a variety of personal projects that I have developed in my spare time. These projects may include:

Programming projects in different languages (Java, JavaScript, Python etc.).
Experiments with emerging technologies (AI, machine learning, etc.)
Web design and development projects.

**How do I organize the projects?**

I consider that the correct organization in the development of a project is very important, that's why all projects are organized in the best possible way. 
Besides containing a README file with its corresponding function.

**Would you be interested in contributing?**

If you are interested in contributing in any way to any of the projects, feel free to make a fork of the repository and send a pull request or contact me through my social networks like:
